            <div class="blog-post-content">
                <p>Spring has arrived, and with it comes an abundance of fresh, vibrant ingredients that inspire our culinary team. We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new spring menu, featuring dishes that celebrate the season's best produce while maintaining our unwavering commitment to 100% gluten-free dining.</p>

                <h2>Celebrating Local Farmers</h2>
                <p>This season, we've strengthened our partnerships with local Florida farms to bring you the freshest possible ingredients. Our new menu features tender asparagus from Green Acres Farm, heirloom tomatoes from Sunshine Organics, and fragrant herbs grown just miles from our kitchen. By sourcing locally, we ensure peak freshness while supporting our community's agricultural heritage.</p>

                <h2>New Starter: Spring Pea Soup</h2>
                <p>Our chefs have crafted a silky spring pea soup that captures the essence of the season. Made with fresh English peas, mint, and a touch of lemon, this vibrant green soup is finished with a swirl of coconut cream and microgreens. It's light, refreshing, and entirely dairy-free—perfect for warming spring evenings.</p>

                <h2>Featured Entrée: Lemon Herb Chicken</h2>
                <p>Our new lemon herb chicken showcases free-range poultry marinated in fresh lemon juice, garlic, and a blend of spring herbs including tarragon, chives, and parsley. Served alongside roasted baby potatoes and grilled asparagus, this dish embodies the bright, clean flavors we love about spring cooking.</p>

                <h2>Seafood Spotlight: Pan-Seared Halibut</h2>
                <p>Wild-caught halibut takes center stage in our newest seafood offering. The fish is pan-seared to golden perfection and served over a bed of quinoa tabbouleh with cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and fresh herbs. A drizzle of herb-infused olive oil ties everything together in this Mediterranean-inspired dish.</p>

                <h2>Sweet Endings: Strawberry Pavlova</h2>
                <p>No spring menu would be complete without celebrating strawberry season. Our pastry chef has created a stunning pavlova featuring a crisp meringue base topped with vanilla bean cream and macerated Florida strawberries. It's naturally gluten-free, impossibly light, and absolutely delicious.</p>

                <h2>Join Us This Season</h2>
                <p>We invite you to experience these new creations and rediscover the joy of seasonal dining. Our spring menu is available now and will evolve throughout the season as new ingredients reach their peak. Whether you're a longtime guest or visiting for the first time, we promise a dining experience that's safe, delicious, and memorable.</p>

                <p>Reserve your table today and taste the best of spring at Zero Trace.</p>
