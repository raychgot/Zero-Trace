                <p>Living with celiac disease doesn't mean you have to miss out on the joy of dining out. With the right preparation and knowledge, you can enjoy restaurant meals safely. At Zero Trace, we understand the challenges our guests face, which is why we've put together these essential tips for navigating the dining world with confidence.</p>

                <h2>1. Research Restaurants in Advance</h2>
                <p>Before heading out, take time to research your options. Look for restaurants that specifically cater to gluten-free diners or have dedicated gluten-free menus. Check online reviews from other celiac diners, and don't hesitate to call ahead to ask about their gluten-free protocols. Dedicated gluten-free facilities, like Zero Trace, eliminate the risk of cross-contamination entirely.</p>

                <h2>2. Communicate Clearly with Your Server</h2>
                <p>When you arrive at a restaurant, be upfront about your dietary needs. Use clear language: "I have celiac disease, not just a preference. Even small amounts of gluten will make me sick." Ask specific questions about ingredients, preparation methods, and whether they use separate cooking equipment for gluten-free items.</p>

                <h2>3. Know the Hidden Sources of Gluten</h2>
                <p>Gluten hides in unexpected places. Soy sauce, salad dressings, marinades, and even some spice blends can contain wheat. Fried foods are often cooked in shared fryers with breaded items. Being aware of these hidden sources helps you ask the right questions and make informed choices.</p>

                <h2>4. Don't Be Afraid to Send Food Back</h2>
                <p>If something doesn't look or taste right, trust your instincts. It's better to ask questions or send a dish back than to risk getting sick. A good restaurant will understand and accommodate your concerns without judgment. Your health is more important than avoiding an awkward moment.</p>

                <h2>5. Build a List of Trusted Restaurants</h2>
                <p>When you find restaurants that truly understand celiac disease and consistently deliver safe meals, keep them in your rotation. Share your experiences with the celiac community through apps and forums. Your recommendations can help others find safe dining options, and their suggestions can expand your own list of go-to spots.</p>

                <h2>Dining at Zero Trace</h2>
