                    <h2>A Restaurant Born from Personal Experience</h2>
                    <p>In 2018, Chef Maria Santos watched her daughter Sofia spend her seventh birthday in a hospital bed—the result of cross-contamination at a restaurant that claimed to offer "gluten-free options." That night, Maria made a promise: no family should ever have to choose between dining out and staying safe.</p>
                    <p>Zero Trace opened its doors in 2019, not as a business venture, but as a solution to a problem Maria knew too well. We built our kitchen from the ground up with one rule: gluten never enters this space. Our name reflects that absolute commitment—zero trace of gluten means zero trace of doubt.</p>
                    <p>What started as a small 30-seat café has grown into a destination for families, couples, and food lovers from across Florida and beyond. We've served thousands of guests who, like Sofia, deserve to enjoy a meal without fear. Every ingredient is verified. Every team member is trained in celiac safety protocols. Every dish is prepared with the understanding that for many of our guests, this isn't a preference—it's a medical necessity.</p>

                <p>The principles that shape every decision we make</p>

                    <h3>Safety Without Exception</h3>
                    <p>We don't take shortcuts. Our facility is 100% dedicated gluten-free—separate from any gluten-containing kitchen. No shared fryers, no shared prep surfaces, no shared utensils. We verify every supplier, test ingredients regularly, and maintain strict protocols because we know that for our guests with celiac disease, even 20 parts per million can cause harm.</p>

                    <h3>Excellence in Every Dish</h3>
                    <p>We reject the notion that gluten-free food is somehow "lesser." Our chefs have spent years perfecting techniques that deliver the textures and flavors you crave—crispy breading, tender pasta, flaky pastry. When guests tell us they can't believe our food is gluten-free, we know we've done our job.</p>

                    <h3>Building Community</h3>
                    <p>Living gluten-free can feel isolating. Restaurant outings, birthday parties, business dinners—events that should be joyful can become sources of anxiety. Zero Trace exists to change that. We're a place where you can celebrate, connect, and simply enjoy a meal like everyone else. You belong here.</p>

                    <h3>Advocacy and Awareness</h3>
                    <p>Celiac disease affects 1 in 100 people, yet it remains widely misunderstood. We partner with local celiac support groups, host educational events, and train other food service professionals in safe practices. Our mission extends beyond our walls—we want to make the entire dining landscape safer for those who need it.</p>

                    <p>A graduate of the Culinary Institute of America with 15 years in professional kitchens, Maria left a promising career at a Michelin-starred restaurant to pursue her true calling. As a celiac parent, she brings both technical expertise and personal understanding to every aspect of Zero Trace. She still personally reviews every supplier relationship and menu change.</p>

                    <p><strong>Head Chef</strong></p>
                    <p>James joined Zero Trace after a decade in high-end Asian restaurants, drawn by the creative challenge of gluten-free cooking. His innovative approach to reimagining traditionally gluten-heavy dishes—think crispy tempura and silky rice noodles—has become a signature of our menu. He leads our kitchen team with precision and genuine care for our guests' wellbeing.</p>

                    <p><strong>Pastry Chef</strong></p>
                    <p>Emma was diagnosed with celiac disease at 23, just as she was finishing pastry school. Rather than abandon her dream, she spent three years developing gluten-free techniques that rival traditional methods. Her desserts have converted countless skeptics, and her flourless chocolate cake has earned a devoted following. She understands what our guests have been missing—and delivers it.</p>
